##Hello everyone!

My name is Lena, I am a junior Front-End developer and I'm excited to introduce myself and share my journey with you.

I am 33, now I live with my family in such a beautiful city as Shenzhen in China and I will share with you pictures from my life in China.

I like to spend time with my family discovering beautiful places and trying new food.
I also got involved in such a challenging hobby as learning Chinese and Finnish languages.

I am a graduate from The State Maritime University in Novorossiysk, Russia with a degree of Engineer of transportation and transport management. During my working career I was engaged in arranging quality and quantity inspections of various cargoes intended for export, and I even essentially contributed into development of software for tracking quality and quantity of oil products.

After moving to China, I transitioned into IT, diving into software testing and automation with Python. I completed several intensive online-courses, worked on various projects using Pytest, Selenium, Playwright, and gained an experience in web and mobile testing. Inspired by my success in automation, I decided to specialize in front-end development because I really like to create and craft, and frontend development gives a visible result of your work.

I completed RS Pre-School Stage 0 and truly enjoyed studying in it. It gave me a big leap in the direction of front-end development, I acquired a lot of useful skills, a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as self-confidence and motivation to continue learning.
At the stage 1 I am doing my best to improve my knowledge and complete all the tasks in order to hone my skills and get new ones, although sometimes I encounter problems with understanding some topics and, of course, lack of time.

Throughout the courses, I built several projects:

- SHELTER: A responsive two-page website featuring a burger menu, pop-ups, an image slider, and pagination.
- AUDIO PLAYER: A functional music player allowing track selection and playback.
- IMAGE GALLERY: A photo search application using the Unsplash API.
- CHICK JUMP GAME: A dynamic JavaScript game inspired by Doodle Jump, where I practiced animation, physics, and interactivity
- CSS MEME SLIDER: A responsive image slider built entirely with CSS and HTML.
- CHRISTMAS SHOP: Similar to Shelter on functionality two-page web-site
- Simon says and Nonograms logical games.

As for my soft skills, I bring strong attentiveness, problem-solving skills, adaptability, and a passion for continuous learning. I am determined to grow as a front-end developer and create user-friendly, high-quality web applications.

I am a quick learner with a strong ability and desire to collaborate with talented professionals and highly motivated to develop my technical proficiency and advance as a frontend developer.

Thanks for your attention!
